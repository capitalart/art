# Codex Log for PR

## 2025-07-26
- Adjusted `edit_listing.html` to load thumbnails from THUMBS via `url_for('static')` with fallback.
- Added inline flash message block to display swap results.
- Created `/review-swap-mockup/<seo_folder>/<int:slot_idx>` route in `artwork_routes.py` and simplified logic.
- Updated swap forms and disabled legacy AJAX in `edit_listing.js`.
- Attempted `pytest` after installing `opencv-python-headless` and `ImageHash`; tests fail due to env vars.
