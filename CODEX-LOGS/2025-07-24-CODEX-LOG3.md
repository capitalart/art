## Date
2025-07-24

## Actions
- Updated `scripts/analyze_artwork.py` to validate `OPENAI_API_KEY` and pass it to the `OpenAI` client.
- Enhanced `_run_ai_analysis` in `routes/artwork_routes.py` with timeout and subprocess error handling.
- Installed `libgl1` so OpenCV imports succeed in tests.

## QA & Testing
- Executed `pytest -q tests` â€“ all tests pass (31 tests).
