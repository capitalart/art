# Codex Log for Public Domain URL & Finalisation Updates

**Date:** 2025-08-03

## Actions
- Updated `config.resolve_image_url` to output public URLs with the brand domain.
- Refactored `generate_public_image_urls` to rely on `resolve_image_url` and support vault paths.
- Revised `routes.utils.update_listing_paths` to swap filesystem and URL prefixes dynamically.
- Enhanced `artwork_routes.edit_listing` for vault path detection and full OpenAI analysis preview.
- Replaced legacy `finalise_artwork` route with new direct-to-vault implementation.
- Restored "Finalise Artwork" button and added full OpenAI analysis section to `edit_listing.html`.
- Adjusted tests for new URL scheme.

## Testing
- `pytest -q`
