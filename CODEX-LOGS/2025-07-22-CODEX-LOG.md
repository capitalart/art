# Codex Log for analysis workflow fixes

## Date
2025-07-22

## Actions
- Added `load_dotenv()` in `config.py` to ensure env vars from `.env` are loaded.
- Created `sanitize_blob_data` in `utils/logger_utils.py` and updated analyzer to avoid logging base64 image data.
- Implemented API key checks and context injection in `app.py`; admin dashboard now warns when keys are missing.
- Updated `routes/artwork_routes.py` to fail gracefully when API keys are absent.
- Exposed progress modal functions and integrated API key checks in `static/js`.
- Added status data attributes in `templates/main.html` and warnings in admin dashboard.

## Testing
- Ran full pytest suite: all 31 tests pass.

## Commit
- `Fix analysis workflows and API key handling` (9 files changed)
