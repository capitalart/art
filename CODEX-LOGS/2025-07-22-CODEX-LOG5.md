## Date
2025-07-22

## Actions
- Added detailed debug logging to `_run_ai_analysis` in `routes/artwork_routes.py` to capture command, environment, stdout/stderr, and cwd.
- Wrapped main invocation of `analyze_artwork.py` and `analyze_artwork_google.py` with try/except to ensure JSON error output on failure.
- Updated logging code to mask API keys and warn when image path missing.
- Ran full test suite with `pytest`.

## Testing
- `pytest -q` â€“ all 31 tests passed.
