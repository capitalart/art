# Codex Log for Master Task on 2025-07-28

## Summary
- Centralised listing path logic into `helpers/path_utils.py` to avoid circular imports.
- Updated `routes/utils.py` and `routes/artwork_routes.py` to import from config and new helper module.
- Added pytest configuration to restrict discovery and installed required packages for testing.
- Improved `load_json_file_safe` logging and added missing helper `find_aspect_filename_from_seo_folder`.
- Optionalised `cv2` import to avoid ImportError when OpenCV unavailable.
