# Codex Log for Dynamic Sellbrite Export Integration

**Date:** 2025-08-03

## Actions
- Implemented `generate_public_image_urls` utility to produce absolute image links for all artwork stages.
- Expanded `update_listing_paths` to update filesystem paths and corresponding public URLs.
- Revised `edit_listing` workflow to inject public URLs, added Sellbrite export details table, and replaced finalisation with a "Lock It In" action.
- Added `/lock-it-in/<seo_folder>` route and updated locking logic to regenerate image URLs when moving stages.
- Updated front-end script to refresh export table URLs and added unit tests for URL generation.

## QA & Testing
- `pytest` â€“ 31 passed, 1 skipped.

## Notes
- No major issues encountered; verified URL generation across stages.
