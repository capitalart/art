# Codex Log for PATCH-01-LOGIN-FIX and PATCH-03-IMAGE-FIX

## Date: 2025-08-05

### Actions
- Added `create_test_image_bytes` helper and login steps to upload tests.
- Updated upload tests to use valid JPEG bytes and asserted error handling.
- Explicitly defined endpoints in `routes/artwork_routes.py` for selection, mockup, and listing management routes.
- Ensured analyze API tests authenticate before requests.

### Testing
- `pytest tests/test_upload.py -q`
- `pytest tests/test_analyze_api.py -q`
- `pytest tests/test_routes.py::test_template_endpoints_valid -q`

### Notes
- Endpoint specifications added to avoid `BuildError` from `url_for` calls.
