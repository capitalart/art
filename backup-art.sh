# This script now uses 'find' to build a list of files and pipes it to 'zip'.
# This is a more robust method that avoids issues with the 'zip -x@' flag.
#
# How it works:
# find . -mindepth 1: Start finding from the contents of the current directory, skipping '.' itself.
# -path 'pattern' -prune: If a file or directory matches the pattern, don't go into it.
# -o: Means "OR".
# -print: If none of the prune conditions are met, print the file/directory path.
#
# The list of printed paths is then piped to 'zip -@', which reads the list
# from standard input.
